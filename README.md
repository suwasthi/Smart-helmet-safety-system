## Smart Helmet with Alcohol Detection and Emergency Alert System

This project enhances rider safety by integrating sensors and communication modules into a smart helmet. It detects alcohol consumption, verifies helmet usage, and senses crashes. If alcohol is detected, the system disables vehicle ignition. In case of an accident, the helmet sends the riderâ€™s GPS location to a mobile app, which locates the nearest hospital and triggers an automatic call via the GSM module, with an optional emergency SMS to family.
