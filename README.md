## Smart Helmet with Alcohol Detection and Emergency Alert System

This project enhances rider safety by integrating advanced sensors and communication modules into a motorcycle helmet. The smart helmet detects alcohol consumption, verifies helmet usage, and senses crashes. If alcohol is detected, the system disables the vehicle ignition to prevent drunk driving. In case of an accident, it sends the rider's GPS location to a mobile app, which finds the nearest hospital and sends back the contact number. The helmet then automatically calls the hospital via the SIM800L GSM module and optionally sends an emergency SMS to a family member.
